# doot.yaml - Configuration file for doot dotfile manager
#
# This file defines how your dotfiles are organized and where they should be
# placed on different systems.

# Version of the configuration format (required)
version: v1

# Mode determines how files are transferred:
#   - file: Copy files (default)
#   - link: Create symbolic links
mode: file

# Plans are named collections of groups.
# Use them to operate on multiple groups at once with a single command.
#
# Examples:
#   doot import plan workstation nux
#   doot export plan minimal mac
#
plans:
  # Empty value means "all groups"
  all:

  # Explicit list of groups
  workstation: [bash, vim, git, tmux]

  # Minimal setup for servers
  minimal: [bash, git]

# Groups organize files by purpose/application.
# Each group has one or more "resolvers" that map to destination paths.
#
# A resolver is just a name for a path. Use different resolvers for different
# systems (e.g., "nux" for Linux, "mac" for macOS) or different machines.
#
# Path expansion:
#   - ~ expands to home directory
#   - $VAR or ${VAR} expands environment variables
#
# Examples:
#   doot import group bash nux    # Import from ~ to ./bash/
#   doot export group bash mac    # Export from ./bash/ to $HOME
#
groups:
  bash:
    nux: "~"
    mac: "$HOME"

  vim:
    nux: "~"
    mac: "$HOME"

  git:
    nux: "~"
    mac: "${HOME}"

  tmux:
    nux: "~"
    mac: "~"

  # You can use any resolver name - they don't have to be OS names
  ssh:
    home: "~/.ssh"
    work: "/home/shared/.ssh"

#
# Each group directory has a .dootignore file that uses gitignore syntax:
#
#   *            # Ignore everything
#   !.bashrc     # Except .bashrc
#   !.profile    # And .profile
#
# If no .dootignore exists, no files are ignored.
